//Level - 2 Problem 2: Bank Account Management System
//Scenario:
//A bank wants to develop a simple console-based application to manage customer bank accounts. The system should protect account balance information and allow controlled access using properties.
//Requirements:
//1.Create a BankAccount class with private fields for account number and balance.
//2.Use properties to allow controlled access to account number and balance.
//3.Implement Deposit and Withdraw methods with proper validation.
//4.Prevent withdrawal if balance is insufficient.
//Technical Constraints:
//• Use private fields with public properties.
//• Apply encapsulation and data hiding.
//• No direct access to balance field from outside the class.
//Expectations:
//• Demonstrate correct use of access modifiers.
//• Validate negative deposit or withdrawal amounts.
//• Display updated balance after each transaction.
//Learning Outcome:
//• Understand encapsulation using properties.
//• Apply data hiding effectively.
//• Implement validation logic inside class methods.
//Sample Input: 
//Deposit = 5000, Withdraw = 2000
//Sample Output: 
//Current Balance = 3000
